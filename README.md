# Thesis Spring 2024

This repository contains the work for the thesis in Spring 2024 regarding the Recipe calculator.

## Coding environment

The file environment.yml contains all packages necessary for running the code.
The environment can be created by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

or (recommended if you have mamba installed, its faster)

```bash
mamba env create --file environment.yml
```

After the environment is created, it can be activated by running:

```bash
conda activate foodcalc
```
